Face Detection Using Python
Project Description

This project implements a face detection system using Python and OpenCV. The application detects human faces from both static images and live webcam video using Haar Cascade classifiers. Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes, and the total number of faces detected is displayed.

The project focuses on basic computer vision concepts and provides a clear understanding of how face detection works in real-world applications.

Objectives

Detect faces from input images

Perform real-time face detection using a webcam

Improve detection accuracy using grayscale image preprocessing

Draw bounding boxes around detected faces

Display face count clearly

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Haar Cascade Classifier

How It Works

The input image or video frame is captured

The image is converted to grayscale

Haar Cascade classifier is used to detect faces

Rectangles are drawn around detected faces

Results are displayed in real time

Features

Detects single and multiple faces

Supports image-based detection

Supports real-time webcam detection

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

Fast and lightweight execution
